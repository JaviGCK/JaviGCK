  <h1>👋 Hi there, I'm Javi!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my coding world!</p>
  <em>"Passionate about styles, beauty in code, and making every detail count!"</em>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
  I believe that great software is not just about functionality; it's also about elegance and aesthetics. Every line of code I write reflects my passion for creating beautiful and efficient solutions. I lose track of time when coding, but that's because I love what I do, and I pour my heart into every project.
</p>

<p>
  I'm not just a developer; I'm a team player with experience managing teams. Communication is key, and I'm easy to talk to and approachable. Empathy is my secret to success. I believe in the power of listening and understanding others' perspectives. By believing in people and fostering a collaborative environment, incredible things can be achieved.
</p>

<p>
  Learning is my fuel for personal growth, and I'm currently expanding my skills in Full Stack development at <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/">AIT.</a> There's always something new to learn, and I embrace the challenge of continuous improvement.
